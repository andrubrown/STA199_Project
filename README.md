# ***** CODE FILES *****
dogcat_sim.R      # File submitted to Gauss for computation

dogcat_sim.sh     # File submitted to Gauss to handle the array job

dogcat_misc.R     # Misc. code such as initial data conversion & recombining

dogcat_class.R    # Classification methods used

data_matrix.RData # The entire matrix of color values. WARNING: Very large!

dogcat_class.RData # Contains results of classification, such as time to complete
                   # or the classifier objects themselves

# ***** PICTURES *****
glm_curve.png     # Represents the classification curve for penalized GLM

rf_error.png      # Shows error rate for random forests given the number of trees
